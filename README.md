# Spinoza - Math & Physics Simulation Project

This is a C++ project for mathematical and physics simulations, providing tools for vector operations, differentiation, and integration using Euler's method. The project is built with pure C++ and does not rely on external libraries beyond the standard C++ library.

### File Descriptions

- **Vector.hpp**: Defines the `Vector` class for N-dimensional vector operations.
- **Function.h**: Implements differentiation and integration methods using Eulerâ€™s approach for vector fields.
- **Vector.cpp**: Implements vector operations.
- **Function.cpp**: Implements numerical differentiation and integration for vector fields.
- **main.cpp**: Contains test simulations demonstrating the capabilities of the project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have CMake installed:

### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

### macOS:
```bash
brew install cmake
```

## Compilation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stdmedoth/spinoza
   cd spinoza
   ```

2. **Create a build directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Generate build files with CMake:**
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will generate the executable `spinoza` in the `build` directory.

## Running Simulations

Execute the program with:
```bash
./spinoza
```

The output will display vector operations, field mappings, and numerical calculations.
