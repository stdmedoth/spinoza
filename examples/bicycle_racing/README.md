# Bicycle Racing Simulation

This repository contains two C++ simulations that model the behavior of a bicycle in a racing scenario. The simulations explore the relationship between power output, velocity, and drag force, calculating the motion of the bicycle over time. The results are stored in CSV files, which can be visualized using a Python script to better understand how different physical factors influence the bicycle’s speed and position.

## Introduction

In real-life bicycle racing, the rider’s power output is a key factor in determining speed. However, as the bicycle accelerates, other forces like air resistance (drag) begin to play a significant role. This repository contains two different approaches to modeling this system:

1. **bicycle_racing.cpp**: This simulation assumes a constant power output and neglects air resistance. The bicycle’s acceleration is solely determined by the rider's power-to-mass ratio.
  
2. **bicycle_racing2.cpp**: This simulation extends the previous model by including drag force, which is proportional to the square of the bicycle’s velocity. The drag force introduces a more realistic deceleration effect at higher speeds, showcasing how air resistance affects the motion of the bicycle.

Both programs output the position and velocity of the bicycle over time, allowing us to observe how these forces influence the bicycle's motion and ultimately its speed.

## System Behavior

### 1. **First Simulation (bicycle_racing.cpp)**

In this simulation, we assume that the power output is constant, and drag force is ignored. The system evolves as follows:

- The bicycle starts at an initial position and velocity.
- The rider applies a constant power (400 watts) to the bicycle, which leads to a steady acceleration determined by the power-to-mass ratio.
- Without drag force, the bicycle keeps accelerating without any deceleration due to air resistance, and the position continues to increase as the velocity increases.

This simple model allows us to see the effect of constant power on the bicycle’s speed and position over time. In the absence of drag, the bicycle’s velocity will increase steadily, with no slowing down.

### 2. **Second Simulation (bicycle_racing2.cpp)**

The second simulation is more realistic, as it introduces drag force into the system. The drag force is modeled as:

\[
F_{\text{drag}} = \frac{1}{2} C_d \rho A v^2
\]

Where:
- \( C_d \) is the drag coefficient (0.5),
- \( \rho \) is the air density (1.22 kg/m³),
- \( A \) is the frontal area (0.33 m²),
- \( v \) is the bicycle's velocity.

In this simulation, the system behaves as follows:

- The bicycle starts with the same initial conditions as the first simulation.
- The rider applies constant power, but as the bicycle gains speed, the drag force increases.
- The drag force gradually reduces the bicycle’s acceleration, causing a slowdown as the bicycle approaches higher velocities.

This simulation highlights the competition between the rider’s power output and the resistance from the air. Initially, the bicycle accelerates quickly, but as speed increases, the drag force grows, leading to a noticeable deceleration. Eventually, the bicycle reaches a steady velocity where the rider's power output is balanced by the drag force.

By comparing the two simulations, we can better understand the impact of drag on cycling performance and how it limits the speed of a bicycle as it races.

### C++ Simulations

1. **bicycle_racing.cpp**: This simulation models the motion of a bicycle with a constant power output, without considering drag force. The program calculates the velocity and position over time, outputting the results in `bicycle_racing.dat`.

2. **bicycle_racing2.cpp**: This simulation improves upon the first by incorporating drag force based on the bicycle's velocity. The program calculates the effects of power output and drag on the bicycle's motion, storing the results in `bicycle_racing2.dat`.

Both simulations are based on a simple physics model, where the acceleration is determined by the power-to-mass ratio, and drag force is proportional to the square of velocity. The data generated by these simulations is saved to CSV files (`bicycle_racing.dat` and `bicycle_racing2.dat`), which can be visualized using the accompanying Python script.

### Python Visualization

- **plot_bicycle_racing.py**: This Python script reads the output CSV files from both C++ simulations and generates plots of the bicycle's position (`x`) over time (`y`). It uses the `matplotlib` library to create the graphs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you run the C++ simulations, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Python 3.x (for running the visualization script)
- Required Python libraries (for the plot script):

  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

### Running the Simulations

1. **Build and Run C++ Simulations**:

   Compile and execute the C++ simulations using your C++ compiler. For example, with `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ bicycle_racing.cpp -o bicycle_racing
   ./bicycle_racing
   ```

   Or for the second simulation:

   ```bash
   g++ bicycle_racing2.cpp -o bicycle_racing2
   ./bicycle_racing2
   ```

   This will generate the `bicycle_racing.dat` or `bicycle_racing2.dat` files in the folder.

2. **Plot the Results**:

   After running the simulations and generating the `.dat` files, you can visualize the results using the Python script.

   ```bash
   python plot_bicycle_racing.py
   ```

   This will create plots of the bicycle's position over time for both simulations.

### Output Files

- **bicycle_racing.dat**: CSV file containing the position and velocity for the simulation without drag force.
- **bicycle_racing2.dat**: CSV file containing the position and velocity for the simulation with drag force.

## Example Output

After running the Python script, you will see plots of the bicycle's motion over time. These graphs will show the effects of drag force (from the second simulation) on the bicycle's speed and position.
